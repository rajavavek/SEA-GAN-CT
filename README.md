**SEA-GAN-CT** introduces a cutting-edge Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture designed to tackle key challenges in medical image synthesis, particularly in CT (Computed Tomography) scans. This model focuses on data augmentation in medical imaging while ensuring privacy-preserving capabilities and achieving high-fidelity results. By maintaining anatomical accuracy and enhancing edge preservation, SEA-GAN-CT presents a robust solution for the limited availability of annotated medical data, especially in high-stakes environments like healthcare.

The proposed architecture integrates multiple innovations to enhance the quality, stability, and diagnostic applicability of synthesized CT images.

**Edge-Aware Mechanism:** The model introduces learnable bilateral kernels, which adaptively enhance anatomical edge features during training. This technique prevents blurring artifacts often seen in traditional methods (such as VAEs or DCGANs) and ensures accurate boundary preservation, especially critical for CT images.

**Layered Generator with Skip Connections:** A layered generator architecture with interpolated skip connections is employed to ensure spatial coherence across generated images. These skip connections help preserve the fine-grained details of high-resolution CT images as the model scales from 64x64 to 128x128 resolution.

**Wasserstein Regularization:** To improve training stability and prevent mode collapse, Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) regularization is used. This loss function ensures that the generator creates more realistic outputs by reducing the gap between real and generated distributions.

**CT Kidney Dataset:** The model is trained on the CT Kidney Dataset, which consists of 12,446 CT images, classified into categories such as normal, cyst, stone, and tumor cases. The dataset is critical for evaluating the performance of the model in synthesizing accurate and diverse medical images.

The results of SEA-GAN-CT model outperforms traditional GAN architectures across multiple metrics, demonstrating its superior capability in generating high-quality CT images.

**1. Quantitative Metrics:**
**Fréchet Inception Distance (FID):** Proposed GAN achieved an FID score of 87, significantly outperforming DCGAN’s FID of 149 and WGAN’s 112. Lower FID indicates higher similarity between the generated and real images in terms of both diversity and realism.
**Structural Similarity Index (SSIM):** SSIM for the proposed model was 0.82, compared to 0.68 for DCGAN, reflecting improved structural fidelity and edge preservation.
**Edge Sharpness:** Achieved 45.2±3.1 in Sobel gradient magnitude, indicating sharper edge features compared to 38.9±4.2 for DCGAN.

**2. Training Stability:**
The proposed GAN model showed 34% fewer fluctuations in training loss compared to conventional GANs, ensuring better stability and convergence across epochs.

**3. Artifact Reduction:**
The synthetic images generated by the proposed GAN exhibited only 6% artifacts, a significant improvement over the 22% artifact incidence in DCGAN outputs. Table show results summary:


| Metric                          | Proposed GAN V2 | DCGAN      | WGAN       |

| **FID Score (↓)**               | **87 ± 2.1**    | 149        | 112        |
| **SSIM Score (↑)**              | **0.82 ± 0.05** | 0.68       | 0.74       |
| **Diagnostic Plausibility (↑)** | **89%**         | 62%        | 71%        |
| **Edge Sharpness (↑)**          | **45.2 ± 3.1**  | 38.9 ± 4.2 | 40.5 ± 3.0 |
| **Artifact Incidence (↓)**      | **6%**          | 22%        | 15%        |



**Contributions:** The dynamically learnable bilateral kernels offer a unique method for adapting edge preservation during image generation, surpassing the performance of fixed-edge models like Ea-GAN.  Skip connections ensure smoother transitions and enhanced spatial coherence, addressing common problems in GAN image generation such as vanishing gradients. The model generates high-fidelity synthetic images that can be used to augment medical datasets, crucial for healthcare environments where annotated data is scarce, while ensuring patient privacy.

The SEA-GAN-CT model offers a breakthrough in privacy-preserving medical data augmentation by combining edge-aware GANs with a stable and robust architecture. It provides a reliable tool for generating high-fidelity CT images, making it an invaluable resource for medical imaging applications, particularly in data-scarce environments. Future work will focus on extending this approach to 3D volumetric image synthesis, multi-modal integration (MRI, PET), and federated learning for even more secure and scalable data generation in healthcare.
